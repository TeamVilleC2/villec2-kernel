# villec2-kernel
Port HTC Sensation's kernel to VilleC2, based on @ivanich's pyramid kernel.

# About this project
VilleC2 is back!
First I've tried porting VilleC2 cm-11.0 kernel by @bilalliberty. However, it can't boot.  
So I think the best way for now is to porting Pyramid kernel. Also, pyramid kernel might be ported from Ville kernel. These devices have lots of common features, so I think it will probably working.  

# L-Day
Maybe today is L-Day :)

# Credits
@ivanich for the Pyramid kernel(brunch cm-12.1). He's a great developer! 99% is his work.  
@Sultanxda for help. Without his help, I don't almost know how to solve the errors when compiling.
@Flemmard for the ramdisk fix.
@DogukanErgun for the bootloop fix.

# Future
Now this kernel is still in the early testing.  
So if I'm sure it works, I'll fork it to @TeamVilleC2 GitHub Group.
