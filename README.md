# villec2-kernel
Port HTC Sensation's kernel to VilleC2, based on @ivanich's pyramid kernel.

# About this project
VilleC2 is back!
First I've tried porting VilleC2 cm-11.0 kernel by @bilalliberty. However, it can't boot.  
So I think the best way for now is to porting Pyramid kernel. Also, pyramid kernel might be ported from Ville kernel. These devices have lots of common features, so I think it will probably working.
